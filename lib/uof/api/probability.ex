  Betradar's Probability API can be used to fetch the probabilities for all
  active markets offered by Betradar's Unified Odds Feed product.

  Probabilities can go down to `1e-10` (ie. `0.0000000001`).

  The only supported sports are: soccer, baseball, basketball, tennis, table
  tennis, badminton, volleyball, squash, handball, ice hockey and field hockey.

  For a fixture to be available in the Probability API, the fixture must be
  active in `Live Odds` and you must have `Live Odds` access to this fixture.
